# IRP_Sensor_Fault_Detection
Air Pressure System fault detection used in a Major Trucking Company. This system uses compressed air to force a piston to give pressure to brake pads that slows the vehicle. The sensors get the data of the piston when Pressure is sent to the brakes

Using APS instead of Hydraulic provides benefits such as Easy Availablity.

This is a Binary Classification Problem. Affirmative class indicates that failure is due to the APS, Negative class indicates the failure is due to someother factors.
